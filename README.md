# Google Images Scraper

Google Images Scraper is a Python tool designed to scrape high-resolution images from Google Images based on provided links. It now supports multi-threading for faster scraping. This tool overcomes the limitations of some browser extensions that only download image thumbnails.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jwiedeman/google-images-scraper.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd google-images-scraper
   ```

3. Create the virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   ```
4. Activate the Virtual Environment:

   ```bash
   # For Linux
   source .venv/bin/activate

   # For Windows Powershell
   .venv/Scripts/Activate.ps1
   # For Windows Command Prompt
   .venv/Scripts/activate.bat
   ```

5. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
<br>

## Usage

1. Run the scraper by executing the following command:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

   This script will fetch high-resolution images from Google Images based on the provided links using multi-threading for faster scraping.

## Configuration

You can customize the behavior of the scraper by modifying the `config.yaml` file.
<br>

### Email Configuration

- `sender_email`: The email address used for sending notifications.
- `receiver_email`: The email address to receive notifications.
- `sender_email_password`: The password for the sender's email account.
- `send_email`: Set True or False for sending emails.

**Note**: If you want to use the email notifications functionality with a Gmail account, it's recommended to generate an [App Password](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/185833?hl=en) instead of using your account password.

### Search Queries

- `search_queries`: List of search queries to use when scraping Google Images. You can add or remove queries as needed.

### Images Limit

- `images_limit`: Set the maximum number of images to download per category. Google tends to load a maximum of 250 images, but can be lower, 200 is reccomended. 
<br>

### Project Info

- `csv_downloads`: Directory to store CSV files containg the original link to each image downloaded.
- `image_downloads`: Directory to store downloaded images.
- `downloader.py`: Contains class to download images using multi-threading.
- `email_service.py`: Provides functionality for email notifications (if needed).
- `scraper.py`: The main scraper class to initiate the scraping process with multi-threading.
- `config.yaml`: Configuration file to set up email and scraping parameters.
- `link_saver.py`: Handles saving image links.
- `main.py`: The main entry point for running the Google Images Scraper.
<br>

## Getting Started

In `main.py`, an instance of the `Scraper` class is created as follows:

```python
sc = Scraper(num_threads=5, show_ui=True)
```

- `num_threads`: You can customize the number of threads, which represents the total browser instances. More threads generally result in faster scraping, but it may increase resource usage. Adjust this value based on your system's capabilities and requirements.

- `show_ui`: The `show_ui` option determines whether Selenium runs in headless mode or not. When set to `True`, it shows the browser UI during scraping. When set to `False`, it runs Selenium in headless mode, which means the browser operates in the background without a visible UI. Choose the appropriate setting based on your preference and needs.

The rest of the process is straightforward:

5. Run the scraper by executing `main.py`:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

6. The scraper will start fetching high-resolution images from Google Images based on the provided links and configurations, using the specified number of threads and UI visibility.

7. Monitor the scraping progress and any notifications sent via email, as configured in `config.yaml`.

## Todo & Completed additions
- [x] Image deduplication, when saving images, we now ensure the same image isnt already saved using `imagehash`. 
- [x] Image saved name uses the next index of the count of images in the result folder, this avoids overwriting images with the same name on subsequent crawls.
- [x] Removed sleeps to speed the process up, will wait for element visibility and immieditely continue.
- [x] Updated Selectors for element interaction
- [x] Added a new case to "scroll more" there are now 3 distinct messages we can recieve that may block scrolling unless clicked.
- [ ] ML Image augmentation export
- [ ] Export downloaded images as a YoloV[X] dataset.
- [ ] Speed up image downloading process
- [ ] Check images pre download against the downloaded links csv to avoid downloading then processing hashes for efficiency.
- [ ] Import search terms via csv
- [ ] CLI commands to clear folders, export, resume where left off
